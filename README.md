# ðŸ›œ Network+ Part 1


This repo was made for the intent purpose of exposing Network+ students to common forms of tech documentation formats, such as Markdown, and version control systems, like Git. Each student will need to fork (not clone) this repo into their own github accounts. Once forked, this repo will then be cloned on to the student's machine. This repo contains pdf copies of the lab assignments and packet tracer files from Cisco Netacad, as well as Markdown files the student will be writing in to answer lab questions and provide screenshots. Once an assignment is completed, the student will commit changes and push to their own forked repo, and provide links to the assignment in the assignment submission box on Canvas. Each set of files has been organized by Module for the student's convenience. See table below for assignment due dates.
