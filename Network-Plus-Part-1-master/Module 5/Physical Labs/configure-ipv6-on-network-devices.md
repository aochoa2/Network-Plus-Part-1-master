## Topology & Addressing Table

| Device | Interface   | IPv6 Address               | Prefix Length | Default Gateway |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| R1     | G0/0/0      | 2001:db8:acad:a::1         | 64             | N/A              |
| R1     | G0/0/1      | 2001:db8:acad:1::1         | 64             | N/A              |
| S1     | VLAN 1      | 2001:db8:acad:1::b         | 64             | N/A              |
| PC-A   | NIC         | 2001:db8:acad:1::3         | 64             | fe80::1          |
| PC-B   | NIC         | 2001:db8:acad:a::3         | 64             | fe80::1          |

## Background / Scenario

In this lab, you will configure IPv6 addresses on hosts and network devices. You will use `show` commands to verify IPv6 unicast addresses and test connectivity using `ping` and `traceroute`.

---

## Required Resources

- 1 Router (Cisco 4221 or comparable)  
- 1 Switch (Cisco 2960 or comparable)  
- 2 PCs  
- Console cables  
- Ethernet cables  
- Terminal emulation software (e.g., Tera Term)

## Part 1: Cable the Network and Configure Basic Router and Switch Settings

### Step 1: Configure the Router

- Assign hostname  
- Configure basic settings  

### Step 2: Configure the Switch

- Assign hostname  
- Configure basic settings  

---

## Part 2: Configure IPv6 Addresses Manually

### Step 1: Assign IPv6 Addresses to R1 Interfaces

- Assign global unicast addresses to G0/0/0 and G0/0/1  
- Manually configure link-local address `fe80::1` on both interfaces  
- Use `show ipv6 interface` to verify link-local address  

**Question:**  
- Which two multicast groups are assigned to interface G0/0/0?  
  _Answer:_  

---

### Step 2: Enable IPv6 Routing on R1

- Use `ipv6 unicast-routing` command  
- Use `ipconfig` on PC-B to verify IPv6 address assignment via SLAAC  

**Questions:**  
- Has an IPv6 unicast address been assigned to PC-B?  
  _Answer:_  
- Why did PC-B receive the Global Routing Prefix and Subnet ID from R1?  
  _Answer:_  

---

### Step 3: Assign IPv6 Addresses to S1 Management Interface

- Assign global unicast and link-local address  
- Use `show ipv6 interface` to verify configuration  

---

### Step 4: Assign Static IPv6 Addresses to PCs

- Configure static IPv6 addresses via Ethernet Properties  
- Verify each PC has both static and SLAAC-assigned global IPv6 addresses  

---

## Part 3: Verify End-to-End Connectivity

- From PC-A, ping `fe80::1` (R1 G0/0/1)  
- Ping S1 management interface from PC-A  
- Use `tracert` from PC-A to PC-B  
- From PC-B, ping PC-A  
- From PC-B, ping `fe80::1` (R1 G0/0/0)

**Note:** If connectivity fails, verify IPv6 address assignments on all devices.

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Why can the same link-local address `fe80::1` be assigned to both Ethernet interfaces on R1?  
   _Answer:_  

2. What is the Subnet ID of the IPv6 unicast address `2001:db8:acad::aaaa:1234/64`?  
   _Answer:_

| 2900         | Gigabit Ethernet 0/0   | Gigabit Ethernet 0/1   | Serial 0/0/0         | Serial 0/0/1         |
| 4221         | Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/0 | Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/1 | Serial 0/1/0         | Serial 0/1/1         |

**Note:** Use interface identifiers to determine router configuration. This table includes common Ethernet and Serial interface combinations.
