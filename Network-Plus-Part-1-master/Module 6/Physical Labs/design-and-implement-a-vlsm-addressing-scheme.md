# Lab â€“ Design and Implement a VLSM Addressing Scheme

## Objectives

- **Part 1:** Examine Network Requirements  
- **Part 2:** Design the VLSM Address Scheme  
- **Part 3:** Cable and Configure the IPv4 Network

## Background / Scenario

Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) allows subnetting a network multiple times to create subnets of various sizes based on host requirements. In this lab, you will use the `192.168.33.128/25` network to design a VLSM scheme for the topology. You will configure router interfaces and allocate addresses for future LANs.

## Part 2: Design the VLSM Address Scheme

### Step 1: Calculate Subnet Information

| Subnet Description   | Hosts Needed | Network Address /CIDR | First Host Address | Broadcast Address |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| BR1 LAN              | 40           |                        |                    |                   |
| BR2 LAN              | 25           |                        |                    |                   |
| BR2 IoT LAN          | 5            |                        |                    |                   |
| BR2 CCTV LAN         | 4            |                        |                    |                   |
| BR2 HVAC C2 LAN      | 4            |                        |                    |                   |
| BR1-BR2 Link         | 2            |                        |                    |                   |

### Step 2: Complete Device Interface Address Table

| Device | Interface | IP Address        | Subnet Mask       | Description        |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| BR1    | G0/0/0    | 192.168.33.249    | 255.255.255.252   | BR1-BR2 Link       |
| BR1    | G0/0/1    | 192.168.33.129    | 255.255.255.192   | 40 Host LAN        |
| BR2    | G0/0/0    | 192.168.33.250    | 255.255.255.252   | BR1-BR2 Link       |
| BR2    | G0/0/1    | 192.168.33.193    | 255.255.255.224   | 25 Host LAN        |

## Part 3: Cable and Configure the IPv4 Network

### Step 1: Cable the Network

- Match the topology diagram

### Step 2: Configure Basic Router Settings

- Assign hostname  
- Disable DNS lookup  
- Set encrypted privileged EXEC password: `class`  
- Set console and VTY password: `cisco`  
- Encrypt plaintext passwords  
- Create login banner

---

### Step 3: Configure Router Interfaces

- Assign IP address and subnet mask  
- Add interface descriptions  
- Activate interfaces

---

### Step 4: Save Configuration and Test Connectivity

- From BR1, ping BR2 G0/0/0  
- From BR2, ping BR1 G0/0/0  
- Troubleshoot if pings fail

**Note:** Pings to LAN interfaces may fail without routing protocols and active interfaces.
