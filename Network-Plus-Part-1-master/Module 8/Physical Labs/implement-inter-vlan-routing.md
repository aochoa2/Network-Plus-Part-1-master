# Lab - Implement Inter-VLAN Routing (MLS and Router-on-a-Stick)

## Topology & Addressing Table

| Device | Interface       | IP Address       | Subnet Mask     | VLAN |
|--------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------|
| MLS    | VLAN 10 (SVI)    | 192.168.10.1     | 255.255.255.0    | 10   |
|        | VLAN 20 (SVI)    | 192.168.20.1     | 255.255.255.0    | 20   |
| R1     | G0/0.10 (subint) | 192.168.10.1     | 255.255.255.0    | 10   |
|        | G0/0.20 (subint) | 192.168.20.1     | 255.255.255.0    | 20   |
| S1     | F0/1             | Trunk to MLS     | N/A              | Trunk |
| S2     | F0/1             | Trunk to R1      | N/A              | Trunk |
| PC-A   | NIC              | 192.168.10.10    | 255.255.255.0    | 10   |
| PC-B   | NIC              | 192.168.20.10    | 255.255.255.0    | 20   |

## Objectives

- **Part 1:** Configure Inter-VLAN Routing using a Multilayer Switch (MLS)  
- **Part 2:** Configure Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS)  
- **Part 3:** Verify Inter-VLAN Connectivity

---

## Required Resources

- 2 Layer 2 Switches (Cisco 2960 or similar)  
- 1 Multilayer Switch (or Layer 3 switch)  
- 1 Router (for ROAS)  
- 2 PCs  
- Console and Ethernet cables  
- Terminal emulation software (e.g., Tera Term)

## Part 1: Configure Inter-VLAN Routing on a Multilayer Switch (MLS)

### Step 1: Configure VLANs and Assign Ports

1. Create VLANs 10 and 20 on the MLS and access switches  
2. Assign PC-A to VLAN 10 and PC-B to VLAN 20  
3. Configure trunk links between switches and the MLS

### Step 2: Configure SVIs on the MLS

1. Enable IP routing on the MLS  
2. Create SVIs for VLAN 10 and VLAN 20  
3. Assign IP addresses as per the Addressing Table  
4. Ensure SVIs are up and active

## Part 2: Configure Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS)

### Step 1: Configure VLANs and Trunking

1. Create VLANs 10 and 20 on S2  
2. Assign PC-A and PC-B to their respective VLANs  
3. Configure trunk link between S2 and R1  

---

### Step 2: Configure Subinterfaces on the Router

1. On R1, configure subinterfaces G0/0.10 and G0/0.20  
2. Assign encapsulation dot1Q and VLAN IDs  
3. Assign IP addresses as per the Addressing Table  
4. Enable the physical interface G0/0

## Part 3: Verify Inter-VLAN Connectivity

1. From PC-A, ping PC-B  
2. From each PC, ping the default gateway  
3. Use `show ip route`, `show vlan brief`, and `show interfaces trunk` to verify configuration  

**Were the pings successful?**
