# Networking Careers in the Cloud and AI Era
***

## Welcome to Network+ Part 1

To kick off our journey into the world of networking, let's explore how the field has evolved and where it's headed. This assignment will help you get a feel for the kinds of jobs available today, how networks are built and managed, and how cloud computing and AI are reshaping the landscape.

## Your Task

Use Google or another search engine to explore the following questions. Take notes and write a short summary of what you discover.

### Research Questions

1. **What kinds of networking jobs exist today?**  
   Look into roles like network administrator, cloud network engineer, and data center technician. What do these jobs involve? 
   - According to Google, some commom entry-level roles include network support specialist which provides assistance to users, troubleshoots network issues. A Network technician installs, maintains, and troubleshoots network systems. Help desk technicians resolve technical problems for users, often the first point of contact for network-related issues.
   Some mid-level roles include a network administrator who oversees the daily operations, maintainence, and security of computer networks, LANS, WANS and cloud networks, amongst other things. Computer systems analyst, analyze organizations computer systems and networks to identify areas for improvement and design ways to make it better. Network security specialists focus on safeguarding networks from cyber threats, including installing firewalls, configuring security protocols, and managing intrusion detection systems. SOme more advanced roles like a network engineer, designs, implements, and maintains computer networks, often playing a critical role in an organization's IT department. Network architect designs complex network systems including local area networks, wide area networks, and cloud based networks.
   Wireless engineers specialize in installing and configuring wireless network systems. CLoud network engineers manage and optimize cloud-based networking solutions, becoming increasingly important as businesses migrate to cloud platforms. Network security engineer designs, implements. and manages security programs to protect an organizations information from cyber threats.

2. **How has the rise of cloud computing changed networking careers?**  
   Explore how companies like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have centralized many networking functions.
   - Cloud computing has altered networking careers by shifting the focus from on site infrastructure to more virtualized, cloud based solutions. Traditional roles have evolved to more remote specialists. System  administrators are becoming cloud engineers and architects, network engineers are becoming cloud network specialists. Cloud computing has also created new roles like cloud solutions architects, cloud security specialists, and cloud data analysts.
   Companies liek AWS, Azure and Google cloud services facilitate communication and routing between different virtual networks and on-sote locations, simplifying network management. Cloud providers maintain, repair and secure networking infrastructure, such as VPN gateway balancers and firewalls. 

3. **Why are smaller organizations using hybrid cloud networks?**  
   Investigate how businesses combine on-premises infrastructure with cloud services, and what challenges they face.
   - Companies are doing this to gain flexibility, scalability, and cost optimization advantages while maintaining control over sensitive data. Many companies use a mix of on-site equipment and cloud services in a hybrid setup. This keeps sensitive data in house while still taking advantage of the scalability and saving money. Although they can run into some challenges while managing the different platforms. Security could also be compromised, the more systems the more opportunities for attacks. Costs could get crazy if they are not being monitored correctly.

4. **How do laws and regulations affect how networks are built?**  
   Search for examples of compliance requirements (like HIPAA or GDPR) that influence network design.
   - Laws and regulations impact how networks are built by making sure everything is in compliance, especially when dealing with sensitive data. Operating in compliance with these laws and regulations make sure that we do not get fined and we can maintain a good reputation. A lot of regulations mandate security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and strong access controls, to protect data. These data protection laws like HIPAA use guidelines for how data is handled and stored. Depending on what kind of data, some sort of encryption may be necesary.

5. **What impact is AI having on networking?**  
   Find out how automation, machine learning, and AI tools are changing how networks are monitored and managed.
   - This is being done by automating tasks, enhancing security, and optimizing performance. These AI tools allow for real-time analysis and anomaly detection by using algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns, identifying anomalies, and can detect potential threats. AI can predict any potential problems by using historical data and real-time data to prevent issues before they impact anyone. Automation is used by AI for repetitive tasks, this can free up any personell for other tasks that need to be done.
