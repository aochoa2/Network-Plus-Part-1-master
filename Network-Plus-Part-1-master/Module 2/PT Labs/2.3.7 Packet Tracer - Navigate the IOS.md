## Reflection Questions

### 1. What did you do in this lab?
I  first connected the PC using a console connection. Then accessed the PCs terminal. Pressed "enter" to get started and then followed step by step from the lab.

### 2. What did you learn?
I learned that the ? is super helpful when you forget a command, and the Tab key can finish the command for you if you just type part of it.

### 3. What did you struggle with or not fully understand?
I'm still having trouble remembering the commands, how to use them, and how to type them correctly. But I'm going to keep practicing on my own.

### 4. What suggestions do you have to improve this lab experience?
The lab was easy to follow with the step-by-step instructions. It was really informative, and I appreciated the hands-on practice.
